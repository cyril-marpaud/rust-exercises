# Rust Exercises

Each exercise requires one to uncomment a specific module in `lib.rs`. **Don't forget to do this!**

- E - Basic exercises: Easy exercises related to basic Rust concepts.
- C - Crate-specific exercises: Medium exercises related to specific crates.
- P - Projects: Advanced exercises involving multiple crates.

## Generate the guide

Run `cargo guide` in any exercise folder to generate and open its documentation, or run it in the root directory to document them all.

```bash
cargo guide
```
