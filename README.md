# Rust Exercises

Each exercise requires you to uncomment a specific module in `lib.rs`. **Don't forget to do this!**

- **E** – Basic exercises: introductory tasks covering core Rust concepts.
- **C** – Crate-specific exercises: intermediate tasks focused on specific crates.
- **P** – Projects: advanced challenges involving multiple crates.

## Generating the guide

Run `cargo guide` in any exercise folder to generate and open its documentation in your browser, or run it from the root directory to generate documentation for all exercises.

This is a cargo alias configured in `.cargo/config.toml`.

## Checking your solutions

Most exercises include a test suite that you can run with `cargo test`.

Use the `-- --nocapture` flag to display your program’s output during tests.
