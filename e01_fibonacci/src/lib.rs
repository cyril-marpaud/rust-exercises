//! # e01_1_recursive - Recursive Fibonacci sequence
//!
//! The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows:
//! - `fib(0) = 0`
//! - `fib(1) = 1`
//! - `fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)`
//!
//! Write a recursive function that returns the n-th number in the Fibonacci sequence. You may use
//! `u64` as the parameter and return types.
//!
//! # e01_2_closed_form - Closed-form Fibonacci sequence
//!
//! The function we previously wrote quickly becomes very slow as `n` grows larger. We can avoid
//! this by using a closed-form expression for the Fibonacci sequence.
//!
//! The closed-form expression for the Fibonacci sequence can be found at
//! <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_sequence#Closed-form_expression>.
//!
//! Write a function that returns the n-th number in the Fibonacci sequence using the closed-form.

// mod e01_1_recursive;
// mod e01_2_closed_form;
