//! # e02_1_imperative - FizzBuzz, imperative paradigm
//!
//! Write a function that takes an integer `n` and returns a vector of strings. The vector should
//! contain the numbers from 1 to `n`, but replacing multiples of 3 with "Fizz", multiples of 5 with
//! "Buzz", and multiples of both 3 and 5 with "FizzBuzz".
//!
//! # e02_2_functional - FizzBuzz, functional paradigm
//!
//! This time, use the functional paradigm to solve the problem. Write an iterator that generates
//! the FizzBuzz sequence from 1 to `n`. The iterator should yield `String`s.

// mod e02_1_imperative;
// mod e02_2_functional;
