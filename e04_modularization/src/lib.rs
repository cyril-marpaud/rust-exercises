//! # e04_1_modularization - Modularization
//!
//! In this exercise, we will modularize the temperature conversion library. The goal is to have a
//! more organized codebase with a clear separation of concerns.
//!
//! Start by moving the `TempUnit` enum into it's own module. Then, create a `prelude` module that
//! exports `Temp`, `Celsius`, `Fahrenheit`, and `Kelvin` (the enum's variants, not the enum itself).
//!
//! Use rust-analyzer as much as you can ! (ðŸ’¡ or **`ctrl`**+**`.`**)
